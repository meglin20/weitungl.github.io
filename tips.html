            <p id="p-text"><em>There are many ways you can incorporate sustainability into your daily activites.</em> One of the ways is through using an app that promotes sustiability and eco-friendly practices! There are many apps that provide guides to sustainable fashion and other practices.</p=>
            <p id="p-small-text">As a student, I find the Forest app to be an extremely useful study tool and a great way to help plant more trees! This app allows users to set an interval of time to stay off their phones,planting a virtual tree on the Frorest App while limiting distraction. If the user exits out of the app before the set time, the planted tree will die immediately. This functionality acts as a mechanism to discoruage users from using their phones during this allocated time. What's cool about this app is that users can spend their virtual coins to plant a real tree. The Forest App has partnered with organizations to help plant trees. This is a great way for those that are unable to volunteer to partake in this global effort to plant more trees.</p>
